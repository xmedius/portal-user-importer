# XMedius Cloud User Importer

**This script allows creating XMedius Cloud users from a CSV file.**

In most cases, the XMedius Cloud AD Sync tool is the preferred method to synchronize users between an Active Directory and the XMedius Cloud Portal. However, if customers do not have an Active Directory or simply do not require synchronization beyond the first importation, they still have the option to use a CSV file to import users. This page explains how to do it.

This tool only adds new user account, it does not update existing ones.

From a console, run the following command:

```

  "password_setup_mode": "manual"
}

```

2. Create a csv called sample.csv

```
username,email,last_name,group,password,language
tirion.lanister,tirion.lannister@westeros.com,Lannister,Casterly Rock,P@s$word,en
```

3. Run xmc-user-importer

## CSV File Format

A sample file is provided, see [sample.csv](https://github.com/xmedius/xmc-user-importer/blob/master/examples/sample.csv). The columns headers must be present.

The comma separated file supports the following column (all values are strings):

```group```         |        N | Group name to assign the user to. If unspecified or if it does not exist in the enteprise account, the enterprise's default group will be used.
```password```      |      Y/N | Password of user, only required if the `password_setup_mode` is manual, ignored otherwise.
```fax_number```    |        N | Fax number to assign to the user for inbound faxing, in E.164 format.

## Error example

When a user fails to be imported, it will print an error message, with the reason for the failure:

```
$> xmc-user-importer config.json sample-with-invalid-data.csv
email@invalid... Failed: {u'email': [u'does not appear to be valid']}
```


## Note

- It is recommended to test the import on one account first and verify that all flows, including email deliveries, are in line with the expected results
- The script does not write any logs to a file, it only prints messages in the console. So when importing a lot of users, it is a good idea to save the output to a file to find user that failed to be imported
- The password used to create the user will NEVER be sent to newly created user or returned to the
  enterprise administrator running the script. When using `"password_setup_mode": "manual"`, the
  enterprise administrator is responsible to communicate the password to the users.
- The welcome emails and fax number assignation email will follow their relevant enterprise settings.
  - Using `"password_setup_mode": "user_choice"` will always send an email to user requesting him to configure his password.
  - If any email notification is turned on (welcome email, password setup, etcâ€¦) provided email addresses must be valid and accepted by your mail server
